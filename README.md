AI lab programs

This repository contains a collection of Artificial Intelligence laboratory programs implemented in Python and Prolog. Below is an overview of each file along with instructions on how to run them.

## Files Overview

### 1. **Astar.py**
- **Description**: Implements the A* (A-star) search algorithm, which is used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python Astar.py
  ```

### 2. **BFS.py**
- **Description**: Contains the Breadth-First Search algorithm, a fundamental graph traversal method that explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python BFS.py
  ```

### 3. **DFS.py**
- **Description**: Implements the Depth-First Search algorithm, another core graph traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python DFS.py
  ```

### 4. **DecisionTree.py**
- **Description**: Demonstrates the creation and usage of a Decision Tree, a machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python DecisionTree.py
  ```

### 5. **GBFS.py**
- **Description**: Implements the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm, which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python GBFS.py
  ```

### 6. **MLFFNN.py**
- **Description**: Contains an implementation of a Multi-Layer Feed-Forward Neural Network, a foundational architecture in deep learning used for various predictive modeling tasks.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python MLFFNN.py
  ```

### 7. **prolog1.pl**
- **Description**: A Prolog script containing logical rules and facts, possibly for solving a specific problem or demonstrating Prolog's capabilities in AI.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  swipl prolog1.pl
  ```
  Then, execute the desired queries within the interpreter.

### 8. **prolog2.pl**
- **Description**: Another Prolog script with additional logical rules and facts, serving as a continuation or complement to `prolog1.pl`.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  swipl prolog2.pl
  ```
  Then, execute the desired queries within the interpreter.

## General Instructions

### Python Scripts
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the scripts, and run them using the `python` command followed by the script name.

### Prolog Scripts
Install a Prolog interpreter like SWI-Prolog. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory with the `.pl` files, and load them into the interpreter using the `swipl` command followed by the script name. Once loaded, you can execute queries as needed.

These programs serve as practical implementations of various AI algorithms and can be used for educational purposes or as a foundation for more complex projects.
